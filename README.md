## FAQ
**Will there be a new version?**
> **Yes, I am currently working on a version 4+ that will attempt to fix the majority of issues with V4. If you have any suggested changes or improvements, shoot me a DM on Discord.**
> **As far as a V5 is concerned, I have no current plans to create a V5. I've debated going the route of custom PCB and also keeping to off-the-shelf components while switching to a smaller board like the SeeedStudio XIAO ESP32C3, but in the end, I have decided not to continue forward with any completely new designs. On the custom PCB front, there are already great designs out there, such as the [CheeseCake and ChocoCake by Sorokage033](https://github.com/Sorakage033/SlimeVR-CheeseCake/tree/main), so I felt designing my own was redundant at this point. And as far as switching to a smaller ESP board, I don't think it's necessarily worth it at this point as the battery optimization is just not quite at the point where I think moving down to an even smaller tracker is particularly worth it with the trade-off to battery life. As for why I'm even working on a V4+, I realize there are still many people wanting to create trackers with just off-the-shelf components, not wanting to or not able to go the custom PCB route (or [official Slimes](https://www.crowdsupply.com/slimevr/slimevr-full-body-tracker) for that matter), so I wanted to fix the problems with my current design and have a case design I can whole-heartedly recommend to people who fit this criteria.**

**Can I use these designs or written guides or pictures in my own project/business?**  
> **Yes! Everything under this repo is in the Public Domain, free for anyone to use for whatever purpose.**

**Do I need to credit you?**  
> **No, but it sure is appreciated!**

**My tracker won't turn on and I can't figure out what's wrong!**  
> **It's almost always a faulty wire connection. Check to make sure everything is still soldered together and there are no shorts anywhere.**

**I don't know how to / can't design my own mounting plate, but still want something custom. What can I do?**  
> **Sorry, but I don't do designs upon request. My designs currently only support the hardware that is mentioned. For any deviation in hardware choice, you will need to modify the designs to fit your needs.**

**How can I support / thank you?**  
> **Shoot me a message on Discord telling me about your build experience! I'm always looking to improve my designs/guides, so feedback is always greatly appreciated. If you want to support me financially, you can support me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/quantumred).**
