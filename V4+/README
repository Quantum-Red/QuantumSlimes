COMING SOON

Fixes to most/all of V4's issues including:
- better mounting plate system with multiple mounting plate designs
- improved lid design (potentially getting rid of need for screws and nuts)
- auxiliary IMU support
- updated build guide to include battery sense and charging diodes
- add native support for other IMUs like MPUs and BMIs

If you currently use or have used V4, please reach out to me on Discord to let me know of any other issues that you'd like to see fixed for V4+
